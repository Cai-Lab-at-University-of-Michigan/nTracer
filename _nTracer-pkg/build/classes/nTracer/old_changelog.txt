 * nTracer_.java
 * Ver 1.1.0
 * Created on June 03, 2018
 
 * Ver 1.0.0 - new data format {Type, xOut, yIn, z, R, synapse, connection}
             - data can be exported as extended SWC format that stores individual neuron traces
             - freehand-tool can be used to draw soma outline
             - Neuron/process tagging (annotation) and selection from commend line
             - 'Alt' instead of 'Shift' key as keyboard shortcut modifier
             - additional "update" button in "Overlay" panel tab for manually update tracing overlay
             - Overlay line width for "All neurons" now can be changed to be thinner than the "selected neuron" overlay
             - fixed many bugs, especially for forming connections

 * Ver 1.0.1 - mark and select processes as incompleted tracing.
             - export SWC in standard or extended format

 * Ver 1.0.2 - Associate each image stack with one nTracer instance (automatically load image at start, quit when close image).
             - fix memory leak by adding garbage collection

 * Ver 1.0.3 - fix "log connections" bugs
             - remove connection/synapse when rename neuronal process type
             - fix bug in selects process (and point) by mouse click, now selects the nearest neuron

 * Ver 1.0.4 - Add scale factor (xOut/y/z resolution) to result file and use it for SWC export
             - Add synapse export for analysis
             - Move batch process from nTracer inferface to an independent plugin
 
 * Ver 1.0.5 - Allow tracing and tagging dendritic spine (added spineTree data structure and mark corresponding point in neurite tracing result as "Spine#n/tag")
             - Allow adding label to selected tracing point (Type/tag*[first incomplete point]; or Type/tag (middle points) or Spine#n/tag [spine point])
             - Fix bug for panel resolution in Mac OS (redraw GUI and rebuild using Mac Netbeans)
 
 * Ver 1.0.6 - Extend "Select neuron from Tag": "=" for equal, "|" for OR, "&" for AND, "!" for NOT operators to select individual tags
             - Bug fixed in "join branch" (add tracing type), "delete point, branch, neuron" (remove spine from data)
             - Batch Process 1.0.6 added batch "log connection", "export skeleton 3D model)"
 
 * Ver 1.0.7 - Bug fixed for not able to use 'Ctrl' hotkey in Mac; removed ImageJ's canvas KeyListener and change all Hotkey modifiers to 'Ctrl'
             - Change "Spine" identifier in "Type" column from, eg. "Spine#3" to "Dendrite:Spine#3"; 
                 and remove the constrain of not able to mark spine at the end point of a branch
             - Removed "Trace" tooltip from toolbar; use "freeline" only.

 * Ver 1.0.8 - Allow RGB (convert to composite) or single channel (monochromatic, duplicate and make 2-channel composite) image to be traced.
             - Fix bug in SWC export; SWC with spine export option
             - Overlay function update: when single neuron is selected, "CONNCTION ONLY" option will assign connections to their connected neuron colors
             - Fix bugs in opening and closing image, saving and loading data file.
 
 * Ver 1.0.9 - Fix exception bugs. Works with ImageJ1.52b with imagescience.jar; Do not use Fiji!
             - Fix coordinate bugs in Alignmaster

 * Ver 1.1.0 - Added a z-projection window to show a substack maximum projection of the current slice to aid tracing. 
               The number of projection slices and the projection area can be adjusted under the "Tracing" parameter tab 
               <Substack Z Projection> (e.g. Z +/- = 5; X/Y = 512 means project +/-5 slices of a 512x512 ROI centered in the middle of the tracing stack).
             - Mouse cursors pointing to the same position are displayed in both images. Image size and magnification level are also synchronized.
             - Hotkeys are added for better tracing experience: 
               "q" = zoom out; "w" = zoom in;
               "j" = select 'magnifier tool' (another way to use mouse left/right clicks to zoom in/out); 
               "h" = select 'free-hand selection tool' (default tracing tool); 
               "space" = select 'scrolling tool' (aka hand moving tool, allow using mouse left click-drag to move image display when zoomed larger than display window).
 * Ver 1.1.1 - Fixed the bug that causes not able to adjust B&C on the main image stack, by removing MouseListener from zProjection image.
             - Hotkeys are added for better tracing experience:
               "," = reduce substack Z projection interval to one previous value
               "." = increase substack Z projection interval to one next value
             - GUI JFrame becomes resizable to accommodate lower res monitors
             - Add soma statistics to calculate soma surface area and volume

  Todo:
 * Ver 1.1.2 - Change data structure for "Synapse" in point table, from "boolean" to "String" to record:
               "0" - non synapse point; "1, 2, 3 ..." numbers as synapse number
               Adapts "Spine" data structure to record all synapse: Type/ xOut/ yIn/ z/ r/ Locale (neurite or soma slice name)
                    Type (Bouton, Post, Spine, ND - not determined)
               Change "Connection" in point table to record the connected synapse #.

 * Ver 1.1.3 
 *          1) Automatic connection identification
 *          2) Volume filling and skeleton centering
 *          3) Integrate tracing results for the same image stack from multiple tracers

 * Future plan:
 *          1) Migration to ImageJ2 to take the advantage of handling large dataset?
 *          2) Merge tracing retuls from overlapping stacks (ImageJ2 native?)
 *          3) Crop/Save tracing image and result (get sub-tracing from selected neurons ?)
