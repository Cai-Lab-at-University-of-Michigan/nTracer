<li> <u>1.50i 25 March 2016</u>
<ul>
<li> The ImageJ website
(<a href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij">imagej.nih.gov/ij</a>)
will soon start using encryption incompatible
with Java so sample images and updates are now downloaded from
<a href="http://wsr.imagej.net">wsr.imagej.net</a>
and URLs used to open images and text files 
are redirected to
<a href="http://mirror.imagej.net">mirror.imagej.net</a>.
<li> Thanks to Thorsten Wagner, added the is("global calibration") macro function.
<li> Thanks to Philippe Carl, added the RoiManager.rename(index,name) method.
<li> Thanks to Nicolas Cedilnik and Mark Hiner, fixed a bug that could cause an
exception when saving a virtual stack.
<li> Thanks to Kees Straatman, fixed a bug that caused the ROI Manager's "Multi Measure"
command to sometimes not work as expected when the "append" option was used.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the "Decimal Places" field in the <i>Analyze&gt;Set Measurements</i>
dialog to be ignored after the value was set to zero.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, fixed a 1.50d regression that caused duplicated images
to lose their density calibration.
</ul>
